### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Abhishek Katyare and I'm an engineer from Nashik, India. I'm here to share with you some of my experiences and insights as a digital professional who loves to develop digital systems and write software to make the world more digital.

I have been coding since I was in college, where I studied computer science and engineering at Savitribai Phule Pune University. I have learned many programming languages and technologies on my own, through online courses, books, blogs, and podcasts. I'm always curious and eager to learn new things and explore new possibilities.

My passion is to create and enhance anything related to technology. Whether it's a website, an app, a game, a chatbot, or a smart device, I enjoy the process of designing, developing, testing, and deploying it. I also like to experiment and research on emerging fields such as IoT, AI, machine learning, deep learning, big data, distributed computing, and parallel programming. I believe that these technologies have the potential to transform the world in positive ways.

I'm not only a coder but also an entrepreneur at heart. I have worked on several projects that aim to solve real-world problems using technology. I have learned a lot from these experiences, such as how to work in a team, how to communicate effectively, how to manage time and resources, how to deal with failures and setbacks, and how to keep improving and innovating.

I'm also a "jugaadu" kind of person. Jugaad is a Hindi word that means finding a low-cost and quick solution to a problem using whatever resources are available. It's a mindset of being resourceful, creative, and adaptable. So if you give me a challenge and a time limit to find a solution for it, and if I don't know anything about it, then I just need one machine and full access to the internet. I'll do research, learn, and develop the solution for that challenge within the given time frame.

Apart from technology and entrepreneurship, I also have other interests and hobbies. I like to read books on various topics such as psychology, philosophy, history, geography, science fiction, spirituality, etc. I like to listen to music of different genres such as Indian classical, old Hindi and Marathi songs, etc. I like to travel to new places and experience different cultures and cuisines. I like to trek and hike in nature and enjoy scenic views. I like to go on solo bike rides. I like to take photos of street scenes and landscapes with my Ricoh GRIII or iPhone.

That's all about me for now. Thank you!ðŸ˜Š
